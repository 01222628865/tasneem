# FUTURE OF EARTH

Final project for the Building AI course FUTURE OF EARTH

## Summary

The biological and geological future of Earth can be extrapolated based on the estimated effects of several long-term influences. These include the chemistry at Earth's surface, the cooling rate of the planet's interior, the gravitational interactions with other objects in the Solar System, and a steady increase in the Sun's luminosity.Finally, the most probable fate of the planet is absorption by the Sun in about 7.5 billion years, after the star has entered the red giant phase and expanded beyond the planet's current orbit. The planet is going through a crisis that could lead to the end of life on it, several factors will be mentioned that led to the rise in temperature. These factors led NASA to search for life on a planet other than Earth. Therefore, we need artificial intelligence in order to create a robot to replace astronauts to avoid any human losses. This robot contains sensors that help it find the appropriate planet

## Background

The luminosity of the Sun will steadily increase, resulting in a rise in the solar radiation reaching Earth, resulting in a higher rate of weathering of silicate minerals, affecting the carbonate–silicate cycle, which will cause a decrease in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In about 600 million years from now, the level of carbon dioxide will fall below the level needed to sustain C3 carbon fixation photosynthesis used by trees. Some plants use the C4 carbon fixation method to persist at carbon dioxide concentrations as low as ten parts per million. However, the long-term trend is for plant life to die off altogether. The extinction of plants will be the demise of almost all animal life since plants are the base of much of the animal food chain on Earth.13 In about one billion years, the solar luminosity will be 10% higher, causing the atmosphere to become a "moist greenhouse", resulting in a runaway evaporation of the oceans.


## How is it used?

The telescope is the greatest instrument used by scientists in the past, which helps NASA to achieve its discoveries so far.but, we need artificial intelligence in order to create a robot to replace astronauts to avoid any human losses. This robot contains sensors that help it find the appropriate planet

## Challenges

The robot will not be able to give accurate results like astronauts

## What next?

In order to implement and develop that robot, I will need astronauts, a group of scientists working at NASA, and engineers to work on that robot.
